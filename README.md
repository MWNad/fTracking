# fTracking
Financial Tracking template for Excel

fTracking compatible only with Bank of America transaction data.

To use, download BOA .csv in excel format. Open fTracking.xlsm, navigate to key sheet, press "get statement" button. Select
downloaded transaction data.

Once data is loaded, navigate to data sheet to see your transactions. Select any transaction for a popup window. Enter keyword
common to all similar transactions, and select from existing categories or add new ones directly. This builds your keyword, 
category, and subcategory pools, which allow you to analyze your transactions.

Once a few transactions have been labeled, you can see basic analysis by navigating to charts page. Most options are placeholders,
but "past _ months," "past _ weeks," and "sort" work.

If you need to edit any data, simply click on that data, and a popup will allow you to do so.
